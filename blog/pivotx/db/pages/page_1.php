weblogger to use and complex enough to meet the demands of advanced webmasters.
It can be used to publish a variety of websites from the most basic weblog to
very advanced CMS style solutions.</p>
<p>PivotX is - if we do say so ourselves - quite an impressive piece of software.
It is made even better through the use of several external libraries. We thank their
authors for the time taken to develop these very useful tools and for making
them available to others.</p>
<p>Development of PivotX (originally Pivot) started back in 2001 and has continuously
forged ahead thanks to the efforts of a lot of dedicated and very talented people. 
The PivotX core team is still very active but keep in mind that PivotX would not be 
what it is today without the valuable contributions made by several other people.</p>";s:10:"convert_lb";s:0:"";s:6:"status";s:7:"publish";s:8:"keywords";s:0:"";s:3:"uid";i:1;s:4:"link";s:13:"/page/welcome";s:11:"extrafields";a:2:{s:5:"image";s:0:"";s:11:"description";s:0:"";}}
