<h3>Note for users and administrator:</h3>


<p>The new encryption system for password <strong>does not require</strong> any migration procedure. This will be done only once at the very next user authentication.</p>


<h3>Notes for developers:</h3>


<p>The new password system implies two backward incompatibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>The function <strong>checkPassword()</strong> (/inc/core/class.dc.auth.php) requires now a <strong>non encrypted password</strong> (usually form field contents) rather than an encrypted form.<br />So you now have to use <code>$core-&gt;auth-&gt;checkPassword($_POST['your_pwd'])</code> rather than <code>$core-&gt;auth-&gt;checkPassword($core-&gt;auth-&gt;crypt($_POST['your_pwd']))</code>.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The function <strong>crypt()</strong> (/inc/core/class.dc.auth.php) no more give the same results with the same parameter. If you need an "old fashion" encrypted password, you have to use <strong>cryptLegacy()</strong> function (same file).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need a <strong>unique UID/key</strong>, use <code>http::browserUID(DC_MASTER_KEY.$core-&gt;auth-&gt;userID().$core-&gt;auth-&gt;cryptLegacy($core-&gt;auth-&gt;userID()))</code> (may be refined in future).</p>";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2018-01-13T12:08:00+01:00";s:2:"TS";i:1515841680;}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:57:"https://dotclear.org/blog/post/2017/08/13/Dotclear-2.12.1";s:5:"title";s:15:"Dotclear 2.12.1";s:7:"creator";s:6:"Franck";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:465:"    <p>A little update to fix a bug with the mustek default template set, used by a lot of themes.

<p>As the team is reduced since a lot of months/years, I decided to reduced the scope in terms of development as I'm the only dev still in activity and I have not more much courage to start (relatively) big projects<sup>[<a href="https://dotclear.org/blog/post/2017/07/27/Dotclear-2.12#pnote-1065-1" id="rev-pnote-1065-1">1</a>]</sup> ‚Äî yes, we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> of 1 in Dotclear.</p>


<p>So exit the REST API I wish to develop ‚Äî but a third party plugin is in development to provide this feature ‚Äî, exit also the integration of the Twig template engine, exit also a lot of <a href="https://dev.dotclear.org/2.0/report/1">tickets</a> which stayed opened without anybody to take care of them.</p>


<p>I will continue to maintain Dotclear, indeed, in order to add some tiny missing features as UTF8-MB4 support for MySQL, a more robust password management and this will be included in the next 2.13 release which will need, at least, PHP 5.5 version ‚Äî it's time to forget the older PHP 5.3 not more maintained now.</p>
